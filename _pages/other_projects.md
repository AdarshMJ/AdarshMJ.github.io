* From 2019-2020, I was associated with the [Underwater 3D Reconstruction](https://cevi.co.in/projects/sponsored/dst-dp) Project.

* I also dabbled in a startup gig called Silicon14 (Tweak Labs) Inc. which I co-founded (I was the CTO :P) while I was in my second year of undergraduate studies. It dealt with developing novel [hardware augmentations](https://xlr8community.github.io/) for enabling rapid prototyping of embedded systems/IoT projects. We designed a new line of micro-controller development boards. The board won the "Best Practical US-Based Project" in a contest organized by [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/adarshmj/accexlron-a-rapid-prototyping-board-5d86c3). I was featured in local newspapers highlighting my entrepreneurial journey -  [Super30 Startups](https://timesnext.com/samar-am-and-adarsh-jamandani-startup-silicon14/), [Deccan Herald](https://www.deccanherald.com/content/649025/city-youth-bring-tech-solutions.html) .
