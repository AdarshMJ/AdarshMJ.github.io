* I also dabbled in a startup gig called Silicon14 (Tweak Labs) Inc. which I co-founded while I was in my second year of undergraduate studies. It dealt with developing novel [hardware augmentations](https://xlr8community.github.io/) for enabling rapid prototyping of embedded systems/IoT projects.
     - My team and I designed a new line of micro-controller development boards called the Accexlron. The board won the prestigious "Best Practical US-Based Project" in a contest organized by [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/adarshmj/accexlron-a-rapid-prototyping-board-5d86c3).
    - We were featured in TimesNext [Super30 Startups](https://timesnext.com/samar-am-and-adarsh-jamandani-startup-silicon14/), as well as in the [Deccan Herald](https://www.deccanherald.com/content/649025/city-youth-bring-tech-solutions.html), a local newspaper that highlighted our entrepreneurial journey.
