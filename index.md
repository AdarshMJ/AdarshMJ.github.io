My name is Adarsh Jamadandi. I am a research assistant at the [Relational Machine Learning Lab](https://relationalml.github.io) led by Dr. Rebekka Burkholz. My research interests include Graph Representation Learning and Geometric Deep Learning. I maintain a list of my publications under the [Research]({{ site.url }}/research) tab.

I am a final year Masters student in Computer Science at the Saarland University. I am actively looking for PhD positions in the field of geometric deep learning and graph representation learning. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any interesting opportunities!

Previously, I completed my Bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering with [Dr. Uma Mudenagudi](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=xBaqwmkAAAAJ&hl=en) as my advisor.

My CV can be found [here](https://adarshmj.github.io/assets/AdarshCV.pdf).
