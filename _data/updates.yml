Why does spectral rewiring work? How important is the graph-task alignment for downstream tasks? We study these questions in our new work, and propose a novel graph rewiring strategy that finds an optimal computational structure in terms of the graph-task alignment and show how it boosts GNN performance!

  content: "New Pre-print Alert! <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04612'>Spectral Pruning Against Over-Squashing and Over-Smoothing</a>. We introduce the Braess Paradox for the first time in context of GNNs. We propose a novel graph pruning strategy that can mitigate both over-squashing and over-smoothing and bonus also find graph lottery tickets!
